# LibBSP
C# library for parsing and reading BSP (Binary Space Partition) structures in Quake-based game engines

The classes in this project exist to parse and store BSP structure information from various formats from many Quake engine forks, including Source and Quake 3.

The BSP Importer for Unity3D and the BSP Decompiler projects both use this library.
